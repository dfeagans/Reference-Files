# OctoPi Set-up Using Raspberry Pi 3b / v2.1 Raspberry Pi Camera #

## Rasperry Pi Set-up ##
Downloaded OctoPi image from: https://octoprint.org/download/

Used Etcher to write image to MicroSD Card: https://www.balena.io/etcher/

Then when it boots up you can either go to octopi.local in your browser, or ssh into the raspberry pi using the credentials username pi and password raspberry with the octopi.local being the address. Either way will let you finalize the set-up steps like set the time and define the printer youâ€™re using.

After that I installed the Malyan-Monoprice Connection Add-in and enabled it (while in the octopi-local browser app settings.

After that I could immediately get it to connect over the octopi.local or 192.168.0.111.

Instead of just pulling power cord, I often used the Shutdown button in the Octopi site. Via ssh in and run `sudo shutdown -h now` and then turn the power cord off.

**Additional Commands:**
Restart OctoPrint: `sudo service octoprint restart`
Restart system: `sudo shutdown -r now (or sudo reboot)`
Shutdown system: `sudo shutdown -h now`

## MP Mini Select Motion Controller Update ##
I updated the motion controller by making sure I could and then getting the files from here: https://www.mpselectmini.com/firmware/motion_controller Then it just required me to format the sdcard a certain way and then load two files on it and put it in. It updated really fast.		 

## Camera ##
The camera I just connected like this one, paying attention to where the contacts and the blue were facing and it immediately worked without me doing anything: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyGM4Iah0cM&vl=en

I wanted to be able to turn off the printer if something went wrong on the webcam so I put my electronic outlet from my bedroom on it and then I can use the alexa app to turn the printer off. That did mean I had to leave the raspberry pi on 24/7.

Then, to get remote access and since I already used astroprint, I added the astroprint add-in which lets the optipi connect to my astroprint login. After installing it, I had to go into settings for astroprint and get my key to paste it into the octopi add-in.
